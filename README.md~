I want to make a game, but am stagnating in making my stardew valley text adventure.

I think I want to make an underail esq game.

Things need to be simpler right off the bat though, I want it to be easily scaleable though.

Features:
    player movement and inspection.
    stores
    quests

all of this has been done before, I want to also make an ascii art graphics for fights, and a rudimentry ai for the
enimies, I also want to incorporate sound into the fights.

This will be a long project.
for today, I will create an engine to run the game out of by instantiating a user and then running an engine function.

tomorrow I will create a style guide and begin working on out of combat movement and inspection.
